# Voter_Predictions
This project used two different data sets on voting between 2010 and 2020. The first data set was an imbalanced data containing 97% of observations as voted. Using SMOTE I balanced the data set to be used in gradient boosted trees and was able to predict voters with an AUC of .97. This includes taking out observations that recorded they voted previously.
